# Lab book and rough notes

## Substantive changes from NetLogo model

- `capture_gap()`: NetLogo uses previous height as agent is dead at time of calling (NetLogo always has a height of 0). Aditionally, a cone angle of 0 is used in NetLogo meaning only current patch is selected with no further expansion. However, even if the desired 45 degree cone was used this would still differ from Julia implementation which only selects an axis line along which to fall.
  - Further for growth form 1 we use the equation as stated in Morales and Perry 2017, which uses both b2 and b3 jobawa (NetLogo only uses b2). For growth form 2 we assign a DBH. unlike NetLogo.

## Possible areas of improvement

- Currently for in patch dispersal two Poisson distributions are used to represent the split of seeds dispersed under the crown and long distance. This would make more sense and likely be more performant to have as only a single distribution correctly allocated.
- The current implementation the assignment step of `ldd_within()` is very messy and slow. It should be refactored
- In `ldd_within()` the fore loop to assign seeds needs to calculate set differences between all cells in distance and all cells in distance - 1 to get only the cells at distance. It has been suggested that an update to the Agents.jl source code is needed to create a function to just get cells at distance
- A number of functions currently pull from globals rather than having local variables created. This has been shown to be less performant and is likely an easy area for performance gain. Current problem functions are:
  - `herbivore_effect`
  - `thin_regenbank()`
  - `macro_litterfall()`
  - `expand_gap()`
  - `assign_demographics()`
  - Model stepping function
- Currently only the last previous species ID and height is recorded in each cell. This could easily be adapted to record all previous trees if desired.
- Create a kill function to avoid duplicate code used every time a tree is killed
- Currently in `regenerate_patch_bank()` new_saplings is used as the amount of individuals to add to both saplings and seedlings

## Additions

- Added phytothera spread and impacts. The disease model is implemented as an SEI (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected) model. Trees can be defined as susceptible/target species in the demography input file
Infection spreads (i.e. trees are exposed) in two ways, a global probability of a target tree getting exposed and a local probability that a target tree will get exposed by an infected neighbour in a predefined infectious radius. The more infected neighbour trees the higher the probability (or rather the more tests are done against that probability) a the target tree gets infected. Neighbours may only infect trees if they have been infected longer than a user defined time period to mimic the time taken for trees to become infectious after exposure. Infected trees may become symptomatic after a determined minimum period of time after infection and symptomatic trees may die with a given probability.

- Added grass as an optional factor. If grass is enabled there is a defined probablilty that grass may invade a patch after a tree dies and a gap establishes. If a patch has been invaded by grass any seeds
landing there only have a probability (rather than a certainty) of establishing into a seedling during dispersal phases. Each dispersal phase and thus each seed entering patch in a step is tested independently.

- Removed previous species for each patch as it is not used and can be accessed directly by data export if needed for analysis.

- Added an adult mortality rate resulting from (pest) herbivory. The adult mortality is calculated using a species specific mean (defined in demography.txt) and user defined variabilty to draw a value from a normal distribution. This value is then tested against a value drawn from a uniform distribution and if the pest value is greater the agent is killed. Note that as we have used the herbivory user input as the on off switch if adult mortality is switched on so is seedling and optionally sapling mortality.

- Added a weather flag that when switched on draws a value from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation defined by the user. This value is added to baseline mortality, so positive values will result in higher mortality rates and lower values will result in decreased mortaility. Currently, seedling and sapling mortality is increased by exactly the same amount as adult mortaility, while it is likely desirable to have the direction and relative intensity of the changes to be correlated it may be that these changes are too small for seedling and saplings and may need some alterations.

- Added a generic gradient based on values in each cell drawn from a random uniform distribution between 0 and 1. This value is used to in association with an exponential distribution to calculate the probability density for that gradient value on that distribution. This probability density is scaled between 0 and 1 and then subtracted from 1 to ensure cells with high values (i.e. higher resources) have higher competitive values remembering lower values result in lower growth (this all occurs in `grow()`). The generic gradient also impacts `capture_gap()` where it is used as the mean of a truncated normal distribution used to draw a weighting value for each species each step. This weighting value is combined with the shade weighting value with the mean used as the overall weight to be used when selecting the species in the lottery function.

## Questions

- How realistic is it to empty the regeneration bank (seedlings and saplings) when a tree grows in a gap?
- Should we implement a species specific phytothera spread rate rather than constants.
- Need to assess the radius of surrounding trees assumed to be able to infect trees with phytothera, current it is radius 2 as literature mentioned short range movement
- Not sure I fully understand the capture gap function in terms of weighting. It seems like the weights increase the relative value of the saplings for the different species, but weights are smaller for more shade tolerant species which means less shade tolerant species would be selected is this correct?

## Possible to do items

- Add impact of edge effect to disease spread. Should be easy enough to just add an extra chance of global infection to edge trees of target species
- Add additional disease impacts resulting from becoming symptomatic.
- Could possibly improve performance by making different agents if there is or isn't disease present as if there is no disease agents require far less parameters
- Currently phytophera is impacted by the growth reduction parameter if edge effects are on. This is to increase the spread for edge cells but as growth reduction is a combination of edge impacts and species competition it may need to be untied to simply be edge effects.
- Add some impact on seedling regeration from other gradients, currently only shade height is taken into account. Implementing this could be as simple as adding a second condition to the if statement in `assign_seedling()` and `ldd_within()`, but some thought will need to be required to ensure that this cutoff is random not static or else some cells may never sprout seeds (this may be desired)
- It may be worth having weather also linked to other factors such as growth with "good" weather causing increased growth and vice versa.
