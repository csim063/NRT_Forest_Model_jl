    #% GROW
    """
    # Grow
    Have each tree grow, i.e. increase their age, height and diameter at breast height. Every tree
    increases their age by 1 every tick and their height and DBH are incremented based upon their
    growth form (either tree or tree-fern) and basic demography equations from Botkin et *al* (1972)
    and Brock et *al* (2019). The incremental growth in height and DBH is down-weighted based on the
    relative amount of shading (due to the height) from neighbouring cells (following Dislich et 
    *al* 2009).

    Function applies a baseline mortality to all agents with a given proportion, as well as
    accounting for age and competitive suppression and density dependent mortality. The function 
    is broken into two broad sections. 1) Simple baseline mortality which is simply a probability
    of a mortality event happening in a tick weighted by debnsity dependent mortality if this is 
    selected. 2) Suppression via low growth and aging mortality.
    ## Arguments:
    - `agent`: Agent object of type `GridAgent` with properties matching those defined by the 
    current model. Note agent must exist (i.e. not have died).
    - `model`: The AgentBasedModel object defining the current model. This object is usually 
    created using `Agents.ABM()`.
    - `cell::Int64`: Patch ID of cell where target tree is located
    - `ddm::Bool`: Boolean indicating whether density dependent mortality should be accounted for 
    or not
    - `species_ID::Int64`: Selected species ID.
    - `base_mortality::Vector{Float64}`: Species specific background mortaility rate. Provided as a
    probability (0-1) of a tree dying in anyone tick.
    - `gap_maker::Int64`: Species specific property indicating whether a species is capable 
    of creating a forest gap (value = 1) or not (value = 0).
    - `expand::BitVector`: Flag indicating that a patch should be checked for gap expansion 
    (value = 1) or not (value = 0). See `expand_gap()`.
    - `previous_height::Vector{Float64}`: Final height of the last tree to have occupied every cell 
    in the current model grid.
    - `a_height::Float64`: Height in meters of the tree.
    - `id::Int64`: Agent ID of the selected tree/agent
    - `age::Float64`: Age (number of ticks alive) of tree
    - `previous_growth::Vector{Float64}`: Growth penalty list for the last 5 ticks worth of growth 
    suppression experienced by the selected tree
    - `supp_tolerance::Vector{Float64}`: Species specific suppression tolerance
    - `supp_mortality::Vector{Float64}`: Species specific probability of mortality due to 
    suppression 
    - `grass::Bool`: Boolean indicating whether grass is present in the model or not
    - `grass_invasion_prob::Float64`: Probability of grass invading a patch
    - `pests::Bool`: Boolean indicating whether pests are present in the model or not
    - `pest_mortality::Float64`: Probability of mortality due to pests (this is the mean in a
        normal distribution)
    - `pest_var::Float64`: Variance of the normal distribution used to calculate the probability
